Takes a single argument of a BMP image and iterates through the image returning RGB values.

Things to implement:
	1. RGB to YIQ conversion (easier to make the proper saturation adjustments)
	2. YIQ to RGB conversion
	3. YIQ saturation manipulator
	4. Logic to apply the new saturated RGB value to the individual pixel
